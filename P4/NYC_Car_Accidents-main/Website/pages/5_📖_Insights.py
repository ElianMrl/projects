# Question 2
st.subheader("2. How many car accidents happen because of city negligence?")

# Question 3
st.subheader("3. What is the trend of accidents yearly (decreasing/increasing)?")
st.markdown("Although, there was a noticeable yearly increase between 2016 and 2018. The pandemic positively affected car accidents. There were fewer car accidents when the pandemic started in March 2020. The country was shut down in 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which was the reason for the decrease in car accidents in New York City. As we recover from the pandemic, there is a notable increasing trend in car accidents each year.")

# Question 6
st.subheader("6. At what time of the day we experienced the most car accidents?")
image6 = Image.open(r"C:\Users\elian\website\data\Images_DEA\Working_hours.png")
st.markdown("New Yorkers usually go to work at 9 AM and finish at 5 PM. Hence New Yorkers start driving at 8 AM to get to their jobs, and they start driving at 5 PM to get to their homes. Accidents peak occurs when people go to work and after they finish working. There is a higher peak at the end of people's shifts. Therefore, there is a clear correlation between the stress generated at work with car accidents. This confirms a correlation between car accidents and the number of drivers.")

# Question 7
st.subheader("7. Which months have the most accidents?")
st.markdown("Looking closely, we notice a peak between May and July, proving that there are more accidents in a warmer climate. One of the reasons for a higher increase in the summer is that after being in winter for most of the year, many people go out, and many new drivers start driving for the first time, causing more car accidents.")

st.image(image8, caption='More Car Accidents in the Hot Summer.')

# Question 9
st.subheader("9. What is the number one factor of a car accident?")
st.markdown("The main contributing factor to car accidents is Driver Inattention (Drivers using their cellphone). Even though the data has a count for drivers using cell phones separated from driver inattention, these two factors should be placed in the same category. One of the main distractions of a driver are cellphones, and many drivers will lie about the reason for their distraction when driving to avoid getting in more trouble by confessing that they were using their cellphone.")
