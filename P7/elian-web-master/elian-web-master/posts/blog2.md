Diving into the world of **Data Science** was not just a hobby; it was a calling. Behind the algorithms and codes, there was an insatiable curiosity, the drive of a self-taught enthusiast who spent free hours exploring the realms of programming and data analytics. Let me share how this passion evolved into a professional pursuit at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT).

### A Natural Affinity for Numbers and Codes

Long before formal education in data science, there was a genuine love for programming. Every free moment was an opportunity to learn a new language, solve a complex algorithm, or work on personal projects. This self-driven exploration was not just about acquiring skills; it was about understanding the vast world of data and its potential to transform industries.

### Pursuing Mastery at NJIT

Recognizing the potential of a formalized education, I took the leap to pursue a Master of Science in Data Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. At NJIT, the journey continued, but now with structured coursework, expert mentorship, and a community of like-minded individuals. This decision was more than just academic; it was about channeling my passion into expertise, bridging the gap between a self-taught enthusiast and a professional data scientist.
