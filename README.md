# Welcome to My Portfolio!

Hello and welcome to my GitHub Portfolio! This repository is a collection of various projects I've been working on during my free time. Each project is organized into its own directory (e.g., P1, P2) for easy navigation.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science while juggling two jobs. By day, I work in the field of Data Science building medical devices and on the weekends, I serve as a lifeguard. Despite the busyness, I find solace in working on personal projects that spark my interest and broaden my skills and knowledge. These projects range across various topics and technologies, and I am excited to share them with the world.

## Projects

My projects are a reflection of my learning journey and my exploration into the world of Data Science and technology. Please note that most of my projects are in progress as I contribute to them in my limited free time. Your patience, understanding, and feedback are much appreciated!

### [P1 - Big Data Analysis - Flight Data](P1/)

In this project, the primary objective is to harness Big Data technologies, specifically utilizing MapReduce in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), to extract meaningful information from a vast dataset of flight data. The analysis focuses on processing and analyzing the data to uncover significant patterns and insights, aiding in a more comprehensive understanding of flight dynamics. As of now, the project is concentrated on the analysis portion, with visualizations slated for future development.

### [P2 - Data Exploratory Analysis - Motor Vehicle Collisions](P2/)

Here, I explored a dataset containing details about motor vehicle collisions. The project aims to identify trends, patterns, and possibly, underlying causes for collisions, helping in the formulation of preventive strategies.

### [P3 - Elian's Personal Website](P3/)

This project is a work in progress, showcasing the development of my personal portfolio website. Built using Next.js, the website serves not only as a platform to highlight my projects but also as a learning endeavor into the technologies of GitHub Workflows and Playwright testing. The choice of these technologies reflects my commitment to learning and utilizing modern development tools and practices, ensuring the website's efficiency and functionality, all while showcasing my personal and professional work.

### [P4 - Motor Vehicle Collision Dashboard](P4/)

Expanding upon the exploration done in "P2 - Data Exploratory Analysis - Motor Vehicle Collisions", this project, "Motor Vehicle Collision Dashboard", represents an advanced version, embodying an interactive dashboard made using Streamlit in Python. The dashboard is enriched with a multitude of features aimed at providing comprehensive insights into motor vehicle collisions.

Key Features:

- A detailed map highlighting areas with malfunctioning traffic devices, defective pavements, and improper lane markings, aiding users in navigating these risk areas more effectively.
- Interactive visualizations offering a more engaging and comprehensive understanding of the data and trends.
- Machine learning models to predict and analyze accidents within special occasions, such as holidays, to help devise preventive and precautionary measures in advance.

The integration of these features into the dashboard provides users with an expansive view, essential insights, and a better understanding of the various facets of motor vehicle collisions.

### [P5 - House Price Estimator](P5/)

The House Price Estimator is a project where I have designed and implemented a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to make the task of estimating house prices straightforward and accessible. This project is not just about the interface; at its core, it utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various selected property characteristics.

By inputting specific property details into the GUI, users receive a reliable estimate of the house price, assisting them in making informed decisions whether they are buying, selling, or just exploring the real estate market. The accuracy and reliability of the predictions are ensured through the use of robust machine learning algorithms that have been carefully selected and tuned for this purpose.

### [P6 - Breast Cancer Prediction](P6/)

In the "Breast Cancer Prediction" project, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis to compare two acclaimed dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The focus of this project was to evaluate and understand the role of these techniques in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of breast cancer prediction.

By conducting an exhaustive study, I have assessed the performance of PCA and LDA in terms of their capability to improve the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. This in-depth analysis not only allowed me to delve into the intricacies of these techniques but also to contribute valuable insights into their applicability and effectiveness in the realm of breast cancer prediction.

Certainly! Here's a more concise version:

### [P7 - Analysis using Supervised Data Mining (Classification) Techniques](P7/)

This project entails a meticulous analysis of two diverse datasets using Supervised Data Mining (Classification) techniques to unveil significant insights.

**Context - Pregnancies Dataset:**

This portion focuses on a dataset involving pregnancies among women in the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in the San Francisco East Bay area from 1960 to 1967. Classification techniques are applied to discern patterns and outcomes, offering insights into pregnancy factors during this era.

**Context - Alzheimer Disease Dataset:**

This segment analyzes the Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Data in the US dataset, concentrating on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Classification methods help identify trends, patterns, and potential risk factors, showcasing their impact and possible preventive measures.

This project accentuates the utility of Supervised Data Mining techniques in yielding deeper insights into diverse health-related domains.

### [P8 - Analysis of Heart Disease Dataset](P8/)

This project involves an in-depth analysis of the Heart Disease Dataset dating from 1988, which comprises four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V.

**Context - Heart Disease Dataset:**

While the dataset comprises 76 attributes, this analysis is confined to a critical subset of 14 attributes, including the predicted "target" attribute signifying the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease in the patient. This project endeavors to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights related to heart disease, thereby contributing to better understanding and potentially enhancing preventive and therapeutic approaches.
